# Shipments List Migration Plan: Bulma to Shadcn + Tailwind

## **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES - MUST FOLLOW BEFORE EVERY STEP**

### **Critical Migration Guidelines**

1. **üîç Always Verify Before Acting**
   - Do not assume anything
   - Always check the plan, old components, and functionalities before each step
   - Review existing code patterns and styles thoroughly
   - Ensure nothing is missed function-wise or style-wise

2. **‚úÖ Checkpoint After Each Step**
   - After each step, ask for UI verification and testing
   - Test yourself against the old code to ensure everything works fine
   - Compare functionality side-by-side with original implementation
   - Validate all interactive elements and user flows

3. **üîí Maintain Full Functional Parity**
   - Maintain full functional parity at all times
   - Every feature, handler, and interaction must work identically
   - No functionality should be lost or degraded during migration
   - Preserve all existing user experience patterns

4. **üßπ Clean Code Practices**
   - Do not introduce unnecessary changes or leave dead code
   - Follow best practices so the code is production-ready
   - Remove all Bulma references completely
   - Ensure code is maintainable and follows project conventions

5. **üéØ Complete Migration Goal**
   - The end goal is complete migration of the page to Shadcn
   - There should be no references to Bulma left anywhere
   - Whenever this page is tagged or the next step is taken, always keep these points in mind
   - Achieve 100% Shadcn + Tailwind implementation

6. **üìÅ Component Organization & Legacy Preservation**
   - All new shadcn equivalent components must be stored in `/packages/ui/components`
   - Legacy components should not be changed at all during migration
   - Create new shadcn components alongside existing legacy ones
   - Maintain clear separation between old and new implementations

### **Before Each Step Checklist**
- [ ] Review the current step in the migration plan
- [ ] Examine existing code and components being modified
- [ ] Understand all functionality that needs to be preserved
- [ ] Plan the exact changes needed without breaking anything
- [ ] Identify any dependencies or side effects

### **After Each Step Verification**
- [ ] Test all functionality works identically to before
- [ ] Verify visual appearance matches or improves upon original
- [ ] Check for any console errors or warnings
- [ ] Validate responsive behavior if applicable
- [ ] Confirm no dead code or unused imports remain
- [ ] Ask for user verification and approval before proceeding

## **Component Migration Priority**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Component Categorization**
Since the draft order PR is not merged yet, we need to separate components by their usage:

### **Priority 1: Shipments-Specific Components (Start Here)**
1. **ShipmentsFilter** ‚Üí shadcn Popover + Form + Checkbox + Input + Button
2. **Tab/Card filters** ‚Üí Custom Card-style components (per reference images)  
3. **ShipmentPreview** ‚Üí shadcn Dialog
4. **Bulk Actions Toolbar** ‚Üí Custom shadcn component
5. **Main table structure** ‚Üí shadcn Table components
6. **Enhanced Pagination** ‚Üí shadcn component with row count display
7. **Sticky Table Wrapper** ‚Üí Custom CSS + shadcn Table

### **Priority 2: Shipments-Specific Styling (No New Components)**
8. **CarrierImage**: Minimal styling updates for consistency
9. **Table layout and structure**: Bulma to Tailwind conversion

### **Priority 3: Shared Components (Defer Until Draft Order PR Merges)**
10. **StatusBadge** ‚Üí shadcn Badge (shared with draft order)
11. **Spinner** ‚Üí shadcn Skeleton (shared with draft order)
12. **AppLink** ‚Üí shadcn Button styling (shared with draft order)
13. **ConfirmModal** ‚Üí shadcn AlertDialog (shared with draft order)

### **No Migration Needed ‚úÖ**
- **ShipmentMenu**: Already uses shadcn DropdownMenu
- **useLoader**: Hook usage, no component migration needed

## **New Features Implementation**

### **1. Rows Count + Pagination Controls**
- **Bottom left**: "Viewing 1‚Äì20 of 50 results" format
- **Bottom right**: "Prev" and "Next" buttons  
- **Data source**: GraphQL `page_info.count` for accuracy
- **Component**: Create enhanced `ShipmentPagination` component

### **2. Card-Style Filters**
- **Convert tabs** ‚Üí Card-based filter components
- **Reference**: Provided card filter screenshot
- **Implementation**: Individual clickable cards instead of tabs
- **Component**: Create `ShipmentFiltersCard` component

### **3. Sticky Columns**  
- **Left column**: Checkbox remains sticky during horizontal scroll
- **Right column**: Three-dot edit menu remains sticky  
- **Reference**: Provided sticky columns screenshot
- **Implementation**: CSS `position: sticky` with proper z-index

### **4. Mobile Responsiveness + Scrolling**
- **Consistent sizing**: Icons, text, row heights
- **Dual scrolling**: Both vertical and horizontal
- **Space optimization**: Minimize empty space without squashing content
- **Reference**: Provided scrolling screenshot

## **Implementation Notes**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Draft Order PR Strategy**
- The draft order migration PR is not merged yet, so we cannot reference its components
- We start with shipments-specific components to avoid duplicating work
- Shared components (StatusBadge, Spinner, AppLink, ConfirmModal) are deferred to Phase 6
- Once draft order PR merges, we can reuse those migrated components
- This strategy ensures efficient development and avoids conflicts

### **Reference Screenshots Analysis**
1. **rows count feature.png**: Shows "Viewing 1‚Äì20 of 42 results" at bottom left with Previous/Next buttons at bottom right
2. **sticky left select column and right edit column.png**: Demonstrates checkbox column staying fixed on left and three-dot menu column staying fixed on right during horizontal scroll
3. **card filter.png**: Shows filter options as individual card components instead of traditional tabs
4. **scrolling.png**: Demonstrates mobile-optimized scrolling with consistent row sizing

### **Current File Locations**
- **Main shipments page**: `/packages/core/modules/Shipments/index.tsx`
- **Shadcn components**: `/packages/ui/components/ui/`
- **Custom components**: `/packages/ui/components/`
- **Status badge**: `/packages/ui/core/components/status-badge.tsx`
- **Carrier image**: `/packages/ui/core/components/carrier-image.tsx`
- **Shipment menu**: `/packages/ui/components/shipment-menu.tsx` (Already Shadcn ‚úÖ)

### **Migration Timeline**
- **Phase 1**: 1 hour (Environment setup)
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 hours (Shipments-specific components)
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 hours (Table structure & enhanced features)  
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 hours (Shipments-specific styling)
- **Phase 5**: 2-3 hours (Integration & testing - shipments-specific)
- **Phase 6**: 1-2 hours (Shared components - when draft order PR merges)
- **Phase 7**: 1-2 hours (Final integration & testing)
- **Total Estimated Time**: 13-19 hours (11-15 hours before draft order PR merge)

This plan ensures a systematic, feature-complete migration from Bulma to Shadcn + Tailwind while adding the requested enhancements and maintaining full functionality.
